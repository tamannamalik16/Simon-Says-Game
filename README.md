# Simon-Says-Game
This is a simple and interactive Simon Says game built using 
# HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I built this game to practice and showcase my skills in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The game challenges players to follow a sequence of colors.
As the game progresses, the sequence becomes longer, testing the playerâ€™s memory and attention.
