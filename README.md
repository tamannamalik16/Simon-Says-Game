# Simon-Says-Game
This is a simple and interactive Simon Says game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges players to follow a sequence of colors.
As the game progresses, the sequence becomes longer, testing the player’s memory and attention.
I built this game to practice and showcase my skills in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s a fun and challenging project that can be played by people of all ages.
